   ```
3. Make the downloaded file executable. If your file is named `supertree`, type:
   ```
   chmod +x supertree
   ```
4. Now, run SuperTree by typing:

## 📝 Usage Instructions

To use SuperTree, type the following command in your Terminal:

```
supertree [optional-path]
```

- Replace `[optional-path]` with the path of the directory you want to view. If you do not specify a path, SuperTree will display the contents of the current directory.

### Example

To view the current directory structure, simply type:

```
supertree
```

To view another directory, like your Documents folder:

```
supertree ~/Documents
```

This will display all files and folders within your Documents folder, formatted in a tree structure.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

- **Permission Denied Error**: Ensure you have set the executable permission with `chmod +x`. 
- **Command Not Found**: Double-check that you're in the correct directory and that the file name is correct.
